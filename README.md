# My first Arduino robot

This is my first Arduino robot. I made this in 2024 when I was first getting into making electronic projects with Arduino. I was trying to make a robotic arm, but it really didn't turn out as an arm.

## For the project, I used

2 SG90 micro servos/
5 pieces of normal cardboard
Hot glue
An assortment of male-to-male and male-to-female jumper wires
An Arduino-compatible ELEGOO UNO R3
A 9-volt battery
A 9-volt battery connector
A 2-prong screw termial

## What else I used

The code from maker101io at:

## How I built it

To build the servo assembly, I also used maker101io's tutorial on YouTube at:
